Our project aims to develop a robust web-based attendance management system tailored 
specifically for educational institutions. This system will revolutionize the traditional methods of 
attendance tracking by providing a comprehensive platform for faculty, students, and 
administrative staff to efficiently manage attendance data and promote student engagement. 
Faculty members will have access to the system through secure login credentials, allowing them 
to mark attendance for their respective classes. The attendance records will be seamlessly 
integrated into the system's dataset, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.Students will have access to their attendance records, 
empowering them to track their progress and identify areas for improvement. Furthermore, the 
system will utilize data analytics to analyze attendance patterns and provide recommendations for 
classes that students should attend to optimize their academic performance.
